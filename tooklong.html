            <p>
                First sorry Mrs. or Ms. Pluska(idk if youre slaying or not), I took way too long on this 
                project. Well first, I sortav just fooled around in class and didnt work, my fault. Second 
                and last I believe, I was learning how to drive stick shift and after your class I had to drive 
                that scary car(petty reason I know lol) but all in all I should have just done the project.
